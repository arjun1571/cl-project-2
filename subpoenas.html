        particularly trafficking and abuse of minors. In an effort to assist law enforcement and other governmental
        agencies in meeting these goals, we strive to assist in pending criminal investigations by providing available
        user data within two (2) weeks. In some cases, additional time is required. In limited scenarios involving an
        imminent threat of death or bodily injury, we may prioritize certain requests to expedite a response, in our
        discretion.

        While we will typically provide available user data in response to requests from all law enforcement officers
        and government attorneys, we reserve the right to insist on receipt of a court order, search warrant, summons,
