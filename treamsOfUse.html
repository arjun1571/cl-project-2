        These Terms of Use constitute a legal contract that establishes the relationship between you, the user, (“you,
        your, yours, etc.”) and us as it relates to your access to and use of MegaPersonals, a platform that allows
        registered users who have passed our strict age verification procedures (“Publishers”) to publish personal
        classified posts (“Posts”). We are the exclusive licensee of all text, images, graphics, photographs, audio,

        By accessing or using MegaPersonals, you accept and agree to our website policies, including these Terms of Use,
        and you certify to us that (a) you are eighteen (18) years of age or older, and are at least the age of majority
        in your jurisdiction; (b) you have the legal capacity to enter into and agree to these Terms of Use; (c) you are
        using MegaPersonals freely, voluntarily, willingly, and for your own personal enjoyment; (d) you will only
        provide accurate and complete information to us and promptly update this information as necessary to maintain
        its accuracy and completeness; and (e) you are aware of the adult-oriented nature of the content on
        MegaPersonals, are not offended by adult-oriented content, are familiar and compliant with your jurisdiction’s

        We reserve the right to revise these Terms of Use at any time. You agree that we have this unilateral right, and
        that all modifications or changes are in force and enforceable immediately upon posting. The updated version
        supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect
        unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions
        thereof in effect. We agree that if we change anything in these Terms of Use, we will change the “Last Updated”
        date at the top of these Terms of Use. You agree to re-visit this page on a frequent basis, and to use the
        “Refresh” or “Clear Cache” function on your browser when doing so. You agree to note the date above. If the
        “Last Updated” date remains unchanged from the last time you reviewed these Terms of Use, then you may presume
        that nothing in these Terms of Use has changed since the last time you visited. If the “Last Updated” date has
        changed, then you must review the updated Terms of Use in their entirety. You must agree to any updated Terms of
        Use or immediately cease use of MegaPersonals. If you fail to review these Terms of Use as required to determine
        if any changes have been made, you assume all responsibility for such omission, and you agree that such failure
        amounts to your affirmative waiver of your right to review the updated terms. We are not responsible for your
        neglect of your legal rights.

        not provide or promote CSAM, and we do not tolerate those who seek to access or share CSAM. In order to further
        our zero-tolerance policy, you agree to report any suspected CSAM as described below. Further, you will not
        allow any minor to access MegaPersonals using your device or account, and you will not share the Materials or
        the Posts with any minor.

        the third-party service provider, not us, for such age verification services; and (iii) your registration and
        approval of your account as a Publisher on MegaPersonals is conditioned upon your payment for and passage of
        such third-party age verification services. We disclaim any liability associated with your violation of the
        policies of any such third-party service. You will not be considered a Publisher for the purposes of these Terms

        providers. We reserve the right to require you to reverify your age with our third-party service providers or
        otherwise reconfirm your age at any time, for any reason.
